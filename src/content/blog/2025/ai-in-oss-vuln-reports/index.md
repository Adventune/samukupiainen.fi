title: The Impact of AI-Generated Security Research on Open Source Projects
description:
    'Artificial intelligence has gained a foothold in security research at the same pace as in other
    areas of life. The phenomenon has proven particularly problematic, especially for maintainers of
    open source (OSS) projects. The theoretical benefits of AI in security research are not
    materializing for OSS maintainers; instead, AI-generated results are burdening developers.'

In May of this year, Daniel Stenberg, the maintainer of the well-known Curl library, made a strong
statement out of frustration regarding AI-generated "AI slop" security reports [1].

Many industry publications interviewed Stenberg regarding the topic, and the issue was prominently
displayed. Stenberg maintains a
[list](https://gist.github.com/bagder/07f7581f6e3d78ef37dfbfc81fd1d1cd) of reports he has received
claiming to find serious vulnerabilities in the Curl library. However, these vulnerabilities do not
exist. Below are a few articles and videos on the topic.

Checking vulnerabilities hallucinated by AI significantly burdens especially maintainers of large
OSS projects. An even larger flood of non-existent vulnerabilities is reported regarding projects
that have an existing open "bug bounty" reward program. You can read more about bug bounty programs,
for example, [here](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/what-are-bug-bounties-and-how-do-they-work).

## Comparable to Denial of Service Attacks

The primary harm of "vulnerabilities" detected by AI is the time spent investigating them.
Maintainers of the Python and Curl projects report increased stress, frustration, wasted time, and
burnout [2], [3]. Stenberg has compared "AI slop" reports to denial-of-service attacks. They shift
resources away from actual development work and erode trust in both the reports and reporters, as
well as in OSS projects [3].

Seth Larson, a member of the Python project's security report triage team, is one of those who have
expressed concern about the topic [2]. He regards AI-generated reports as if their intent were
malicious, even if they do not aim for that [2].

## Deafening noise

"AI slop" reports do not only burn developers out. The flood of hallucinated reports drowns out real
reports [4]. At worst, AI hallucinations can even stifle open source projects entirely [4].
Developers participating in OSS projects do not initially spend their time improving security [2].
Erroneous reports turn interest away even further.

## Something Positive

AI is a powerful tool, and it can be that in this field as well. Joshua Rogers, working in the
security sector, found over a hundred issues in the curl library using purely AI tools [5]. I did
not find a comment in Stenberg's Mastodon post stating that any of these were vulnerabilities. This
is still a demonstration of AI's efficiency in code analysis when guided by the right hands.

## Concluding Words

AI is an instrument that scales the user's activity – for better or for worse. In unskilled hands,
it acts like a spam cannon, burdening volunteer maintainers who are already stretched thin and
threatening even the vitality of entire projects. As the Curl case and Stenberg's frustration show,
the problem is not fundamentally in the technology itself, but in its irresponsible use, where the
hope of quick cash supplants professional skill and diligence.

So that the open source community does not suffocate in this digital pollution, a change is needed
in both the rules of bug bounty platforms and reporting culture. However, Joshua Rogers' example
casts hope: when AI is harnessed as an expert's tool rather than their replacement, it can
significantly improve software quality. Future security research will benefit from AI's computing
power, but it will not survive without critical assessment and validation performed by humans.
