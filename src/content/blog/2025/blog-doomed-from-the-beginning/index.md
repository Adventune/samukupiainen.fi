-- Hello??

I recently moved my website from being built with `Gatsby` to `Astro`. At that point I also
remembered that I had setup a blog system.. I had an idea and interest for a single post in January
2023, when I could not find any instructions for a
[Docker registry authentication setup](/2023/docker-registry-access-control) and wrote them myself.
That was pretty much it for the blogging part of my site.

I am really glad to have made the switch over to `Astro` for a couple of reasons. 1) a lot of
unnecessary custom implementation "spaghetti code" was removed and 2) the built-in blog system. To
be clear, I don't believe that I will get any better at coming up with anything interesting to
write, but now I at least have a frictionless platform to write in case that was to happen.

I didn't plan on creating any meaningful content now either, apart from pointing out my shameful
lack of content before someone else does. But at least I now have an [RSS-feed](/rss.xml).
